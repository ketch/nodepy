Overview
========

NodePy (Numerical ODEs in Python) is a Python package for designing,
analyzing, and testing numerical methods for initial value ODEs.
Its development was motivated by my own research in time integration
methods for PDEs.  I found that I was frequently repeating tasks that
could be automated and integrated.  Initially I developed a collection
of MATLAB scripts, but this became unwieldy due to the large number
of files that were necessary and the more limited capability for
code reuse.

NodePy represents an object-oriented approach, in which the basic
object is a numerical ODE solver.  The idea is to design a laboratory for
such methods in the same sense that MATLAB is a laboratory for matrices.
Some distinctive design goals are:

  * **Plug-and-play**: any method can be applied to any problem using the
    same syntax.  Also, properties of different kinds of methods are
    available through the same syntax.  This makes it easy to compare
    different methods.
  * **Abstract representations**: Generally, the most abstract
    (hence powerful) representaton of an object is used whenever
    possible.  Thus, order conditions are generated using products
    on rooted trees (or other recursions) rather than being hard-coded.
  * **Numerical representation**: The most precise representation possible
    is used for quantities such as coefficients: rational numbers (using
    SymPy's Rational class) when available, floating-point numbers otherwise.
    Where necessary, method properties are determined by numerical
    calculations, using appropriate tolerances.  Thus the "order" of
    a method with floating-point coefficients is determined by checking whether
    the order conditions are
    satisfied to within a small value (near machine-epsilon).
    For efficiency reasons, coefficients are always converted to floating-point
    for purposes of applying the method to a problem.

In general, user-friendliness of the interface and readability of
the code are prioritized over performance.

NodePy includes capabilities for applying the methods to solve
systems of ODEs.  This is mainly intended for testing and comparison;
for realistic problems of interest in most fields, time-stepping in
Python will be too slow.  One way around this is to wrap Fortran or
C functions representing the right-hand-side of the ODE, and we are
looking into this.

.. note:: The online documentation is not comprehensive.
          For more complete documentation, it is best to
          refer to the docstrings of specific functions and classes.


Dependencies
============

  * Works with Python 3.5+
  * Requires: Numpy, Matplotlib, Sympy
  * SymPy (note: NodePy is now compatible with SymPy 0.7.1)
  * Optional: networkx (for some Runge-Kutta stage dependency graphing),
    cvxpy (for finding optimal downwind perturbations),
    scipy

Classes of Numerical ODE Solvers
================================

NodePy includes classes for the following types of methods:
    - :ref:`Runge-Kutta Methods <create_rkm>`
        - Implicit
        - Explicit
        - Embedded pairs
        - Low-storage methods
        - Extrapolation methods
        - Integral deferred correction methods
        - Strong stability preserving methods
        - Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods
    - :ref:`Linear Multistep Methods <create_lmm>`
    - :ref:`Two-step Runge-Kutta Methods <create_tsrkm>`

Arbitrary methods in these classes can be instantiated by specifying
their coefficients.


Analysis of Methods
===================

NodePy includes functions for analyzing many properties, including:
    - Stability:
        - Absolute stability (e.g., plot the region of absolute stability)
        - Strong stability preservation
    - Accuracy
        - Order of accuracy
        - Error coefficients
        - Relative accuracy efficiency
        - Generation of Python and MATLAB code for order conditions


Testing Methods
===============

NodePy includes implementation of the actual time-stepping algorithms
for the various classes of methods.  A wide range of
:ref:`initial value ODEs <ivp>` can be loaded, including the DETEST suite of problems.
Arbitrary initial value problems
can be instantiated and solved simply by calling a method with the
initial value problem as argument.  For methods with error estimates,
adaptive time-stepping can be used based on a specified error tolerance.
NodePy also includes automated functions for convergence testing.

In the future, NodePy may also support solving semi-discretizations
of initial boundary value PDEs.
