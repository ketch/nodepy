    "# Internal stability of Runge-Kutta methods, revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously looked at internal stability of some classes of Runge--Kutta methods in [this notebook](https://github.com/ketch/nodepy/blob/master/examples/Internal_stability.ipynb), also posted on my blog [here](http://www.davidketcheson.info/2012/10/11/Internal_stability.html).  There I gave a formula for the internal stability polynomials based on the Butcher coefficients of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that internal stability depends on the manner in which a Runge--Kutta method is implemented.  That is, two mathematically equivalent implementations of the same method can have quite different internal stability polynomials and internal amplification factors.  This is rather surprising, since the *stability polynomial* that we traditionally study doesn't depend on the particular implementation.\n",

    "The stability function tells us by how much errors from one step are amplified in the next one.  This is important since we introduce truncation errors at every step.  However, we also introduce roundoff errors at the each stage within a step.  Internal stability tells us about the growth of those.  Internal stability is typically less important than (step-by-step) absolute stability for two reasons:\n",

    " - Roundoff errors are typically much smaller than truncation errors, so moderate amplification of them typically is not significant\n",
