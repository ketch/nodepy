# Installation

    pip install nodepy

This will automatically fetch dependencies also (numpy, matplotlib, sympy, scipy).  It will not fetch
cvxpy, which is an optional dependency (used only in a few specialized routines).

# Overview

NodePy (Numerical ODEs in Python) is a Python package for designing, analyzing,
and testing numerical methods for initial value ODEs. Its development was
motivated by my own research in time integration methods for PDEs. I found that
I was frequently repeating tasks that could be automated and integrated.
Initially I developed a collection of MATLAB scripts, but this became unwieldy
due to the large number of files that were necessary and the more limited
capability for code reuse.

NodePy represents an object-oriented approach, in which the basic object is a
numerical ODE solver. The idea is to design a laboratory for such methods in
the same sense that MATLAB is a laboratory for matrices.

Documentation can be found online at

To get started, you can also have a look at the `examples` folder,
beginning with an [introduction as Jupyter notebook](examples/Introduction%20to%20NodePy.ipynb).
